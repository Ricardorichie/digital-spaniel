  React JS- 5874commerce test solution
  </b><br>
</p>

This is the solution to the 5874commerce frontend task for frontend developers. It is written with ReactJS, Typescript and bundled with vite. The state management was implemented with redux-toolkit. Also, Redux-toolkit was used to define "endpoints" that describe how to retrieve data from faker "backend" faker server running on the frontend with RTK's createApi. The faker api was created with the help of "json-server" serving a json file in the base folder of the project "db.json"
